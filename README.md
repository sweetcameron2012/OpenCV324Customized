This repository contains [podspec](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html) of [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) framework built as a dynamic library. It can be used as a dependency in any CocoaPod and will work correctly with Swift and/or Objective-C projects.

To add it to your project:

`pod 'OpenCV-Dynamic', '~> 3.x'`

Do add it as a dependency to an existing CocoaPod:

`spec.dependency 'OpenCV-Dynamic'`

# Building

For the pod to build correctly, please make sure **cmake** is available from command line, by running `cmake` command. You can install it with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):
